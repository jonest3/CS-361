So, this is my first try and collecting all the parts and working them
together.... its a work in progress. 


So far,
   1) login works, just not with a db yet. (except a local one)
   2) upload works, just barks at some column error. (AMAZED IT GOT THAT FAR)
   3) delete and view are... returning 500. I worked on them the "least" so..
   4) css is all done in main.css, 
   5) common validators are in index.js. 

And thats all for now folks. sorry.
